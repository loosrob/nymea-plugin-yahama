# Yamaha AV Receiver

This plugin allows to control your Yamaha (non-MusicCast) AV receivers. (To add: Each supported receiver on your local area network should appear automatically in the system.)

This is an experimental version that doesn't use autodiscovery yet, most (but not all) actions for the main zone are implemented; zones are a work in progress.

## Supported Things

* Yamaha RX-V675
* Other non-MusicCast Yamaha RX-V devices should also work, but haven't been tested
* Newer Yamaha MusicCast devices aren't supported, as they use a different API

## Requirements

* nymea and the Yamaha device must be in the same local area network.
* The package "nymea-plugin-yamaha" must be installed.
