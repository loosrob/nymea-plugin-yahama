# Yamaha AV Receiver

This plugin allows to control your Yamaha (non-MusicCast) AV receivers.

Each supported receiver on your local area network should appear automatically in the system.

Browsing is supported, but can be slow due to the nature of the Yamaha API.
As a nice extra, a random album on a random server can be started with a simple action. 

## Supported Things

* Yamaha RX-V675 (tested)
* Other non-MusicCast Yamaha RX-V devices should also work, but haven't been tested
* Newer Yamaha MusicCast devices aren't supported, as they use a different API

## Requirements

* nymea and the Yamaha device must be in the same local area network.
* The package "nymea-plugin-yamaha" must be installed.
